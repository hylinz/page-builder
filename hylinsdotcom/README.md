Decide upon page desinger component setting data structure, can currently be passed in as anything to the edit component
Something that will allow for dynamic rendering of inputs, maybe direct onchange value updates to the array? Like a temporary array then on saving I pass it back and replace the original one, that way I'll always maintain sane data

In any case most important is to ensure that I dont have to build fucking input fields every damn component, they should be dynamic

type bool, type str etc
